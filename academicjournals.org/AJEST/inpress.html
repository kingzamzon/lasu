</p>
<p class="date">Article in Press</p>
<p class="content-page">Improper disposal and burning of agricultural residues are commonly practiced in some developing countries in which harmful gaseous products released into the atmosphere and some are depleted and reacted with the soil causing environmental pollution. Renewable technology can therefore be introduced for the utilizationof the residues and ensure proper storage medium of the residues. An investigation was carried out on the...</p>
