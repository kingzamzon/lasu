	The study evaluated developmental responses associated with plant population density stress applied at different phenological phases and effects on grain yield in determinate and indeterminate soybean (Glycine max L.). A split-split plot design with four replications, with variety (main plot), plant density (sub plot) and thinning time (sub-subplot) was adopted. Two determinate genotypes (Lu...</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Sub-acute and chronic toxicity of silver nanoparticles synthesized by Azadirachta indica extract</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/A0BFB2D63881</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/A0BFB2D63881</guid><description>
	In this study, biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and its toxicity were investigated. Different functional groups responsible for adsorption, morphology and absorption of the nanoparticle were characterized using UV-Vis, Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses, respectively. The toxicity of orally administered Azadirachta i...</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Optimization of plant growth regulators for meristem initiation and subsequent multiplication of five virus tested elite sweet potato varieties from Ethiopia</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/C5E398963883</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/C5E398963883</guid><description>
	Vegetatively propagated crops are exposed to pests every growing season, providing them with the opportunity to feed on the plants and transmit diseases. Meristem culture is an important method to clean for viruses to restore high yields. Media optimizations with different concentrations and combinations of 6-benzylamino purine (BAP) and Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) were tested for their ef...</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Selection for and biochemical characterization of DDT resistance in laboratory strains of Anopheles arabiensis</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/39DFE1463887</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/39DFE1463887</guid><description>
	Resistance to conventional insecticides still constitutes a major obstacle to control of malaria vectors. Xenobiotic pollutants encountered by aquatic stages of natural populations of malarial vector species in agricultural and domestic environment are often selected due to resistance to various insecticides. The Laboratory Matatuine (MAT) and Kayamba (KGB) strains of Anopheles arabiensis we...</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Comparison and optimization for DNA extraction of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.

	The extraction of high-quality DNA from okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L. Moench) is notoriously troublesome due to the high contents of polysaccharides, polyphenols, and different secondary metabolites. We have tested seven extraction buffers on silica dried okra leaves. Here, we describe a simple, rapid and modified procedure for high-quality DNA extraction from okra, which is amenable for d...</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Lactic acid bacteria fermentation of coconut milk and its effect on the nutritional, phytochemical, antibacterial and sensory properties of virgin coconut oil produced</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/40EF7B663912</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/40EF7B663912</guid><description>
	Coconut oil has profound health benefits but the high content of fatty acids is a concern to many consumers, as several processing methods have failed to produce oil with considerable change in fatty acid content. In this study, selected lactic acid bacteria including Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Enterococcus faecium were used to ferment coco...</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Morphological and proteomic analyses of Zea mays in response to water stress</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/AF280DB63672</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/AF280DB63672</guid><description>
	Water stress affects plant growth and development, leading to agricultural crop losses in maize cultivation. It also threatens food security in economical crops such as maize, one of the major crops produced worldwide. Transcriptomic studies associated with morphological assessments have been widely conducted on the mechanisms of crop development and stress response; however, data on maize i...</description><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Morphological and molecular characterisation of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz) isolates obtained from Dioscorea rotundata (Poir)</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/D0662D063674</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/D0662D063674</guid><description>
	Anthracnose disease is a major constraint to yam production in tropical West Africa and anywhere the crop is cultivated. This study determined the cultural characteristics and growth rates of mycelia and also characterised 6 isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, the causal agent of the yam anthracnose disease, obtained from Dioscorea rotundata leaves, vines and setts in the Tolon Distr...</description><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Evaluation of different methods for total RNA extraction from Thaumastocoris peregrinus</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/299B43B63676</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/299B43B63676</guid><description>
	Thaumastocoris peregrinus is a pest that damages eucalyptus plantations. Recently in Brazil, there are few studies related to its control. With the advancement of molecular biology, several techniques can assist in the discovery of an effective and sustainable control. The different techniques of analysis of gene expression start with the extraction of the total RNA from the material for gen...</description><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>HPTLC fingerprint profiles and UPLC-MS identification of potential antioxidant fractions and compounds from Ambrosia maritima L. and Ammi majus L.</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/A29CEB263684</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJB/article-abstract/A29CEB263684</guid><description>
	
		This study aimed to develop HPTLC fingerprint profile and identification of antioxidant molecules from active extract and fractions of Ambrosia maritima and Ammi majus using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS). The antioxidant activity evaluated by using DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl) method and HPTLC fingerprinting were carried out using CAMAG HPTL...</description><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
