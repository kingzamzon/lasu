<p class="date">May 2020</p>
<p class="content-page">
This paper concentrated on hesitancy as a character&#39;s flaw from the Freudian psychoanalysis focal point. Hamlet&#39;s uncertainty is especially identified with his natural complex which frames his oblivious love for his mom and his lethal abhor for his dad. Freud&#39;s ideas of man&#39;s concealed want for annihilation and eradication may shape the reason for understanding Hamlet&#39;s craving for death and suicide...</p>

<p class="heading">The contribution of Freud’s theories to the literary analysis of two Victorian novels: Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre</p>
<p class="date">May 2020</p>
<p class="content-page">
Sigmund Freud&#39;s psychoanalytical theories can be used with reference to the analysis of literary works. Reading novels, poems and other compositions through the lens of psychoanalysis gives the opportunity to analyse and evaluate the works of literature in their genesis and presentation. Freudian doctrine can be considered as a reading tool that allows the investigation of the enigmatic areas of human experience...</p>

In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the semantic roles of applicative arguments in Ruluuli-Runyala. We present the semantic roles of applicative objects in view of the participant roles as semantically defined under sense relations: There is a general assumption that arguments of a verb could be allocated only one of these roles. The analysis follows the theoretical framework which contextualises...</p>

<p class="date">January 2020</p>

This paper examines the relationship between visuality, knowledge and power in the postcolonial African novel. With examples from selected texts of Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o and Sony Labou Tansi, it argues that visual culture, usually employed in the analysis of cultural images and material iconographies in media studies, can aptly be employed in textual analysis given that postcolonial novels are primarily engaged with...</p>

<p class="heading">“What a Lark! What a Plunge!” The influence of Sigmund Freud on Virginia Woolf</p>
<p class="date">June 2019</p>
<p class="content-page">
To what extent did Sigmund Freud influence Virginia Woolf? Although they shared an advocacy for truth by means of stream of consciousness narration and free association, Woolf claimed to have had only superficial knowledge of Freud. Even if this was true, she could not help but be aware of his theories of psychoanalysis through the media of her day or by way of her publisher Hogarth Press, which published Freud. As...</p>

Literature of the Black Diaspora locates within its multi-layered gamut, a kaleidoscope of artistic productions; self-narratives careered by the quest for identity and self-expatriation from a ruthless atmosphere of slavery and racial subjugation. Studies have fixated on thematic preoccupation, language form in works of Afro-American and Caribbean traditions. Not so much has been explored especially on identity and...</p>

<p class="heading">Capitalism versus narcissism: Death of a salesman's psychoanalytic critique</p>
<p class="date">September 2018</p>
<p class="content-page">
Arthur Miller&#39;s, Death of a Salesman seems to have lost some ground to its once established position as many critics of late downplayed the demise of its protagonist Willy Loman by inscribing the causes of his death on &#39;narcissism&#39; and excessive self-importance other than delving into the deeper causes behind his tormented and isolated private life.

The African people have varying behaviours, mannerisms, beliefs, thought patterns and way of interaction and all of these differences formed their culture and impacted their way of life.

<p class="content-page">
&lsquo;Repetition&rsquo;, as a literary technique, was effectively applied in Julian Barnes&rsquo; The Sense of an Ending. It was used to explain the imperfection and subjectivity of both memory and history, and to show the richness of human emotions that cannot be generalized by any universal philosophy. However, this particular technique has not been sufficiently explored by researchers. Regarding this, the study...</p>

<p class="content-page">
The fusion of eroticism and misogyny is perhaps one of the most prominent characteristics of Cavalier poetry. Women are generally idealized, having their bodies figuratively dismembered, listed from the head down, and compared to pure and beautiful objects through the use of simile and exaggeration (Scott-Baumann, 2008). Furthermore, it is common for women to be portrayed as physically, emotionally and intellectually...</p>

The article utilises Philip Chidavaenzi&rsquo;s The Haunted Trail and Virginia Phiri&rsquo;s Highway Queen to argue that female characters pragmatically turn to prostitution when the society, which should nurture morality in humanity, turns immoral against them.
