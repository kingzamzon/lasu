	Most of the mouse experiments tend to generate a large-scale data, which is needed to be stored and eventually made publicly available. Many research groups still struggle to have central storage and integrated management system of this metadata. Some existing tools like Microsoft excel sheets and couple other colony management web/cloud-based tools are either cumbersome or expensive. There ...</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Creating E-pedigree Kanban to secure customers&#x2019; chain using multi-agent image technique</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/7C47A8159582</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/7C47A8159582</guid><description>
	Egypt is one of the countries mostly faced with the problem of Chinas fake spare parts used in replacing original components. The spare parts components trade is close to 2.7 billion LE out of 9.3 billion LE, that is, the volume of imported spare parts in Egypt, as announced by the official speaker of the Ministry of Trade and Industry in Egypt. Hence, it can be seen that Chinas components a...</description><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Optoelectronic properties of zinc blende and wurtzite structured binary solids</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/DC4DD528645</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/DC4DD528645</guid><description>
	

	In this paper, we studied zinc blende (ZB) and wurtzite (Wu) type structured binary solids with conduction electrons and calculated the optoelectronic properties such as high frequency refractive index (n), optical susceptibility (), electronic polarizability (e) and crystal ionicity (fi) using the plasma oscillation theory of solids formalism already employed for ternary chalcopyrite s...</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Comparison and performance analysis of reactive type DSR, AODV and proactive type DSDV routing protocol for wireless mobile ad-hoc network, using NS-2 simulator</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/ED724198648</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/ED724198648</guid><description>
	

	Routing in MANET is a critical task due to highly dynamic environment. A routing protocol is needed whenever a packet needs to be transmitted to destination via number of nodes and numerous routing protocols have been proposed forad-hocnetwork. In this paper we try to judge the impact of both reactive as well proactive type protocols by increasing the density of nodes in the network, ke...</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Optimization of spatial join using constraints based- clustering techniques</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/1A366B68625</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/1A366B68625</guid><description>
	

	Spatial joins are used to combine the spatial objects. The efficient processing depends upon the spatial queries. The execution time and input/output (I/O) time of spatial queries are crucial, because the spatial objects are very large and have several relations. In this article, we use several techniques to improve the efficiency of the spatial join; 1. We use R*-trees for spatial quer...</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>New approaches to automatic headline generation for Arabic documents</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/3D60A928637</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/3D60A928637</guid><description>
	

	A headline is considered a condensed summary of a document. The necessity for automatic headline generation has been on the rise due to the need to handle a huge number of documents, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. Instead of reading every document, the headline can be used to decide which ones contain important and relevant information. There are two major approaches to ...</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Hybrid time-frequency domain adaptive filtering algorithm for electrodynamic shaker control</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/A6DB1928614</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/A6DB1928614</guid><description>
	

	In this paper, adaptive filtering algorithm for control of the vibration force applied on the specimen in testing control systems is presented. Application for adaptive filtering especially in Time Domain is associated with a high computational complexity. This complexity is mitigated by using frequency-domain adaptive filtering scheme. In this paper adaptive filtering algorithm in asso...</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Integrated service quality enhancement of wireless optical communication systems for long haul transmission distances</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/86B0FA88602</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/86B0FA88602</guid><description>
	

	Optical wireless communication network is gaining acceptance in an increasing number of sectors of science and industry, owing to its unique combination of features: Extremely high bandwidth, rapid deployment time, license and tariff-free bandwidth allocation, and low power consumption, weight, and size. The demand of high signal bandwidth in optical wireless communication networks is g...</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Tool for evaluation using virtual reality</title><link>https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/AA5794F8571</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://academicjournals.org/journal/JECI/article-abstract/AA5794F8571</guid><description>
	

	This paper shows an educational software for evaluation of Formal Languages subject. Along with a simple interface of easy understanding and application, it is going to present exercises where the student will visualize the automaton on 3D and shall develop the regular expression and in a second moment shall develop a minimization of the automaton interacting directly to the 3D object. ...</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
